# =========================================


# The language that MCDR will use to display information
# Examples: "en_us", "zh_cn"

# The working directory of the server. If you use the default value server/ I will suggest you put all the files related to the server into the server/ directory
working_directory: server


# The console command to start the server. Examples:
start_command: java -Xms12G -Xmx32G -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar server.jar nogui


# The handler to the specific way to parse the standard output text of the server and the correct command for server control
#   vanilla_handler    , for Vanilla / Carpet / Fabric server
#   beta18_handler     , for Vanilla server in beta1.8 versions
#   bukkit_handler     , for Bukkit / Spigot server with Minecraft version below 1.14, and Paper / Mohist server in all version

# The codec format to encode messages to stdin / decode messages from stdout of the server
# Leave it blank for MCDR to use the system encoding

# MCDR -> Server
encoding: utf8

# Server -> MCDR
decoding: utf8


# The list of directory path where MCDR will search for plugins to load
